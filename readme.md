Common Build Specification
==========================

This is the repository for the Common Build Specification; a mechanism for
describing how to build and distribute a software package such that it may 
be easily performed by any build tool.

If you have [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/) installed, the provided
`Makefile` may also be used to render the latest version of the specification
locally. (Or run `sphinx-build` directly with your favorite options. Note
however that non-HTML output is not tested and may not work.)
